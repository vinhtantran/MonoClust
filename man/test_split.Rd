test_split(
  current,
  members,
  members_l,
  members_r,
  auto.pick,
  method,
  data,
  split_var,
  node,
  rep,

  parallel
)
}
\arguments{
\item{current}{Row index of the current considered split.}

\item{members, members_l, members_r}{Vector of the index of observations that
are members of the parent node, left child node, and right child node,
respectively.}

\item{auto.pick}{Whether the algorithm stops when p-value becomes larger than
\code{sig.val} or keeps testing and let the researcher pick the final splitting
tree. Default value is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{method}{Can be chosen between 1 (default), 2, or 3. See description
above for the details.}

\item{data}{The data set which is being clustered.}

\item{split_var}{Splitting variable at \code{current} split.}

\item{node}{The current node index}

\item{rep}{Number of permutations required to calculate test statistic.}

\item{stat}{Applied to methods 2 and 3. Statistic to use, choosing between
\code{"F"} (default) or \code{"AW"}.}

\item{parallel}{Number of parallel processes or a predefined socket
    cluster.  With \code{parallel = 1} uses ordinary, non-parallel
    processing. The parallel processing is done with \pkg{parallel}
    package.}
