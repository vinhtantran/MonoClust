\title{monoClust: Perform Monothetic Clustering with Extensions to Circular}
\description{
Implementation of the Monothetic Clustering algorithm on continuous 
  data set. A lot of extensions are included in the package, including applying
  Monothetic clustering on data set with circular variables, visualizations with
  the results, and permutation and cross-validation based tests to support the
  decision on the number of clusters.
}
\details{
The package performs Monothetic clustering on numerical variables only data.
The extended features include clustering on one circular variable, limiting
the sets of splitting variables. There are also S3 functions such as print
and plot that works for MonoClust output object.
