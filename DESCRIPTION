Description: Implementation of the Monothetic Clustering algorithm on continuous 
  data set. A lot of extensions are included in the package, including applying
  Monothetic clustering on data set with circular variables, visualizations with
  the results, and permutation and cross-validation based tests to support the
  decision on the number of clusters.
