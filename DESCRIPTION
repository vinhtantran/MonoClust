Description: Implementation of the Monothetic Clustering
    algorithm (Chavent, 1998 <doi:10.1016/S0167-8655(98)00087-7>) on
    continuous data sets. A lot of extensions are included in the package,
    including applying Monothetic clustering on data sets with circular
    variables, visualizations with the results, and permutation and
    cross-validation based tests to support the decision on the number of
    clusters.
